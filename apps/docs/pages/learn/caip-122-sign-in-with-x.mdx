Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize digital identity and authentication by allowing users to create self-sovereign identities that are not controlled by a centralized authority. This can greatly improve user privacy and security by giving users greater control over their personal information and authentication credentials.

## One Standard

However, creating a unified and interoperable standard for blockchain-based authentication has been a challenge, as different blockchains have their own unique protocols and data structures. This has led to a proliferation of different authentication methods and standards, which can be confusing and difficult for users to navigate.

## The specification

The Sign in With X specification aims to address this challenge by defining a chain-agnostic data model that can be used to authenticate and authorize blockchain accounts with off-chain services. The specification describes how blockchain accounts should authenticate and authorize with off-chain services by signing a chain-agnostic message parameterized by scope, session details, and security mechanisms.
