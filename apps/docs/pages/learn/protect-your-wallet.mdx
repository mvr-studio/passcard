<Article title="Protect your wallet">
If you own a cryptocurrency wallet, you must take steps to protect it. Here are some tips to help keep your wallet secure:
## Always question
Be cautious when sharing your wallet address. Since the blockchain is public, anyone with your wallet address can see your entire transaction history. Consider if you're comfortable tying your identity to it and exposing everything inside of it.
## Risk diversification
Consider having more than one wallet. Many people choose to have multiple wallets that serve different purposes. For example, having a "social wallet" that is tied to their public identity while also having a "hardware wallet" that is anonymous. Make use of features like Rainbow, which lets you create as many wallets as you need.
## Back it up
Backup your secret phrase or private key somewhere safe. These two things are what give control over a wallet. It's important to back them up someplace safe because they are the only things that could let you back into your wallet if you lose access.
## No bystanders
Never share your secret phrase or private key with anyone. Accidentally leaking or sharing your private key and secret phrase means your wallet is permanently compromised. Private keys and secret phrases are unchangeable, so your only course of action would be to start a new wallet.
## Hardware wallet
Consider investing in a hardware wallet. If you have a significant amount of money, getting a "cold" hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger can provide greater protection. These wallets are meant for longer-term holding of assets that you aren't using regularly. A software wallet like Rainbow is still secure and best for being your "daily driver" or "social wallet."
## Avoid scams
Follow tips to avoid crypto scams. Just like in traditional finance, there are bad actors looking to steal your assets. It's not hard to avoid these scams if you know what to look for.

In conclusion, protecting your cryptocurrency wallet is essential to keep your assets secure. Following these tips can help prevent unauthorized access and minimize the risk of losing your cryptocurrency.
