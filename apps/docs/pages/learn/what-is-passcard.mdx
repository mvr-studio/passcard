Passcard is an open source authentication toolkit that allows application developers to implement a secure and user-friendly login system for their applications. Leveraging the power of crypto wallets, Passcard allows users to log in to applications with ease and convenience, while ensuring a high level of security for their data.

## How it works

At its core, Passcard detects the presence of crypto wallets in the user's browser. Currently, Passcard detects dozens of popular crypto wallets within the Cardano, Ethereum, Mina and Solana blockchains. Once the user selects a blockchain, Passcard prompts the user to sign a message containing all the necessary session information. This message is then sent to the application's backend, where it is verified to ensure that the signature matches the correct crypto address.

If the verification process is successful, the user is logged in and the session is persisted. This process ensures that only the legitimate owner of the crypto wallet can access the application, making it a highly secure authentication system.

## UI Library

In addition to its authentication capabilities, Passcard also provides a set of UI components that developers can use to quickly and easily create decentralized applications (dapps). These include components for enrollment forms, account management, and transaction processing. By using these components, developers can save time and effort while creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for their applications.

## Open Source

Passcard is built on open source principles, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. This makes it a powerful tool for the blockchain community, allowing developers to work together to create more robust and secure dapps.

In summary, Passcard is a powerful authentication toolkit that enables developers to implement a secure and user-friendly login system for their applications. By leveraging the power of crypto wallets and providing a set of UI components for creating dapps, Passcard is poised to become a popular choice for developers looking to create innovative and secure decentralized applications.
